## Purpose of this Repository

This repository presents the scientific and immunological rationale behind individualized brain tumor immunotherapy protocols developed by Biotherapy International.

It does not represent a clinical trial, randomized study, or standard-of-care treatment.

The approaches described here are applied on a personalized and compassionate basis where legally permitted.

## Scientific Foundation

The conceptual framework is based on decades of clinical and translational work in:

- Cellular immunotherapy  
- Alloreactive immune responses  
- Minimal residual disease targeting  
- Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  
- Immune modulation after tumor debulking  

---

## Brain Tumor-Specific Considerations

Brain tumors present unique biological and clinical challenges including:

- Blood brain barrier limitations  
- Immunologically cold tumor microenvironment  
- High recurrence rates  
- Limited penetration of systemic therapies  

This framework outlines the immunological logic used to address these challenges.

## Transparency Statement

No claims of proven efficacy in glioblastoma or other brain tumors are made.

Clinical outcomes may vary and depend on individual patient characteristics and regulatory approvals in the country of treatment.
