# Scientific Rationale

The immunotherapy framework described in this repository is based on established principles of tumor immunology and cellular therapy.

Key scientific foundations include:

- Activation of alloreactive immune responses  
- Targeting minimal residual disease  
- Immune activation following tumor debulking  
- Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  
- Modulation of tumor immunogenicity  

These mechanisms have been extensively described in the scientific literature and form the conceptual basis for individualized therapeutic approaches.
