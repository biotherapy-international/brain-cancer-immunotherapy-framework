# Translational Relevance to Immunotherapy

The molecular mechanisms described in glioma stem cell research highlight the biological complexity, plasticity, and resistance patterns characteristic of high grade brain tumors.

Glioma stemness, tumor heterogeneity, and adaptive signaling pathways contribute to recurrence and therapeutic resistance.

From a translational perspective, these biological features provide a rationale for immune mediated targeting strategies aimed at residual, resistant, or treatment refractory tumor cell populations.

The conceptual immunotherapy framework described in this repository is informed by this understanding of tumor biology and focuses on immune activation against resistant malignant cells in individualized clinical contexts.
