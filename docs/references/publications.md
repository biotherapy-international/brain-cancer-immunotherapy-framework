# Selected Scientific Publications

The scientific framework presented in this repository integrates principles of tumor biology, stem cell regulation, and immune mediated tumor targeting.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern glioma stemness, tumor progression, and cellular plasticity is essential for the development of rational immunotherapeutic strategies.

The publications listed below contribute to the biological and translational context underlying this conceptual framework.

## Glioma Biology and Tumor Stem Cell Research

The following publications contribute to the understanding of glioma stemness, tumor progression, and molecular regulation in glioblastoma:

1. Slavin S. et al. MicroRNA-137 is downregulated in glioblastoma and inhibits the stemness of glioma stem cells by targeting RTVP-1. Oncotarget. 2013.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.928

2. Slavin S. et al. MicroRNA-145 is downregulated in glial tumors and regulates glioma cell migration by targeting connective tissue growth factor. PLoS One. 2013.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054652

These studies explore molecular pathways involved in glioma stem cell maintenance, tumor progression, and mechanisms potentially associated with tumor resistance and recurrence.
